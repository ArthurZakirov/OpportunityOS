# OpportunityOS

Turn high-volume applications, registrations, and browser searches into repeatable opportunity workflows.

OpportunityOS packages agent skills for the messy operational layer behind finding and pursuing opportunities: searching portals, shortlisting matches, tracking candidates, preparing handoffs, filling low-risk fields, repairing required documents, and stopping before human-only actions such as CAPTCHA, legal acceptance, payment, identity verification, or final submission.

The repo is not just "admin automation." The higher-level purpose is to increase throughput and quality for opportunity creation: apartments, jobs, programs, marketplaces, registrations, and similar search-then-apply workflows.

## What It Helps With

- Search portals against explicit criteria and maintain a tracker.
- Prepare browser handoffs for applications, inquiries, registrations, or submissions.
- Repair low-quality ID scan PDFs when a workflow requires presentable documents.
- Separate agent-safe preparation from human-only decisions and submissions.
- Reuse the same workflow structure across apartments, jobs, vendors, programs, and other opportunity surfaces.

## Included Skills

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED SECTION: skills -->
> Generated from tracked `skills/*/SKILL.md` metadata.

| Skill | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `browser-search-and-handoff` | Human-in-the-loop workflow for browser-based sourcing, shortlisting, and next-step preparation across marketplaces and portals. Use when Codex needs to search websites for entities that match user-defined criteria, collect results in a tracker, find each entity's follow-up action page or application form, prefill low-risk fields where appropriate, and stop for human-only steps such as CAPTCHA, OTP, legal acceptance, payment, identity verification, or final submission. Typical triggers include apartment hunting, job search, dating or partner discovery, vendor sourcing, and similar search-then-contact or search-then-apply workflows. |
| `normalize-id-scan-pdf` | Repair low-quality or awkwardly laid-out ID scan PDFs. Use when a PDF of a personal ID, passport, or driver's license needs page content rotated without changing the page orientation, scaled up to use more of the page without clipping, renamed with stable bronze/silver/gold filenames, self-checked for cut-off content, or opened locally for final review. |
